        "In this experiment, I evaluated different prompting strategies on a GSM8K math word problem using Gemini Flash. The one-shot numeric prompting approach produced reasonable results but occasionally failed on multi-step problems, suggesting that minimal guidance is insufficient for structured reasoning tasks. The two-shot numeric prompting improved consistency slightly, indicating that providing multiple examples helps the model better infer the expected format and reasoning pattern.\n",
        "\n",
        "The most significant improvement came from two-shot chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. Encouraging step-by-step reasoning reduced arithmetic errors and improved logical consistency. The structured “Final answer: integer” constraint also made output parsing reliable. Adding prompt refinement—specifically instructing the model to verify its calculation—further stabilized performance. The verification step reduced small arithmetic slips and improved robustness.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, reasoning-based prompts clearly outperformed direct numeric-answer prompts. The experiment demonstrates that LLM performance on mathematical reasoning tasks is highly sensitive to prompt structure. Explicit reasoning instructions and light verification constraints meaningfully enhance reliability. This aligns with prior research showing that chain-of-thought prompting improves multi-step reasoning accuracy in large language models."
